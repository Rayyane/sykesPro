The App Store's strict review guidelines don't allow cannabis-related apps, so the product was <strong>directly launched</strong> on the market as a webapp, in order to <strong>test the traction</strong> and <strong>validate the idea</strong>.</h4></div></section><section id="challenge"><div class="content"><h3 class="light">Target and challenge</h3><h4 class="light">Cancare has a very clear target, a target that needs an <strong>extremely easy</strong> and <strong>fast to use</strong> solution. The app looks professional and distances itself from the recreational cannabis usage. <strong>Reliability</strong> was another key point: the real-time shipment tracking solves the usual shipment-related anxiety and <strong>builds trust</strong> from the first checkout.</h4></div></section><section id="problem"><div class="content"><h3>Problems solved</h3><h4>After some weeks of negotiation, the founder didn't reach an agreement with the dispensaries that were supposed to be part of the project. The image below shows the <strong>impact</strong> that an issue like that would have on a <strong>normal release cycle</strong>.</h4><img class="img-lg" src="img/img-cancare-scoping-lg.png" alt="Cancare Scoping Large"> <img class="img-sm" src="img/img-cancare-scoping-sm.png" alt="Cancare Scoping Responsive"><h4>The founder decided to launch the app with just one partner. To <strong>differentiate</strong> the product and <strong>stand out</strong> from the competition, one month before deployment, we <strong>iterated</strong> on the already available design, to find a new, compelling feature. That’s the moment we gave birth to the <strong>real-time tracking</strong>.</h4><img class="img-lg" src="img/img-cancare-flow-lg.png" alt="Cancare Flow Large"> <img class="img-sm" src="img/img-cancare-flow-sm.png" alt="Cancare Flow Responsive"><h4>This is a really clear example of how great it is to work with people who understand the importance of a <strong>loose scope.</strong> A change of plans doesn't necessarily mean harmful, uncontrolled feature creep.</h4></div></section><section id="outcome"><div class="content"><h3 class="light">Outcomes and achievements</h3><h4>Considering how rapidly the medical cannabis market segment is evolving, Cancare required a <strong>fast turn around</strong>. The app got <strong>to the market</strong> in just three months, and it was already winning over most competitors thanks to its <strong>usability</strong> and <strong>reliability</strong>. After a quick marketing campaign, the founders have been able to <strong>generate revenues from day one.</strong></h4></div></section><section id="details"><div class="content"><div class="row"><h5>The main screens</h5><p><strong>Shop</strong>, <strong>categories</strong>, and <strong>search</strong>: colors, font sizes, and product listing layout were determined by running multiple <strong>A/B tests</strong>. For the listing, it turned out that a grid arrangement slightly <strong>increased the conversions</strong>, thanks to its professionally shot pictures.</p><div class="row-content triple-column"><article><img src="img/img-cancare-home.jpg" alt="Cancare Home"></article><article><img src="img/img-cancare-categories.jpg" alt="Cancare Categories"></article><article><img src="img/img-cancare-search.jpg" alt="Cancare Search"></article></div></div><div class="row"><h5>Details and cart</h5><p>The <strong>details</strong> screen shows an accurate breakdown of the effects and pathologies treated by the specific strain. Those aspects can be also filtered from the listing screen itself. These specs were crucial to highlight the <strong>medical connotations</strong> of the app.</p><div class="row-content double-column"><article><img src="img/img-cancare-product.jpg" alt="Cancare Product"></article><article><img src="img/img-cancare-cart.jpg" alt="Cancare Cart"></article></div></div><div class="row"><h5>Shipment tracking, in real-time</h5><p>The real-time tracking doesn't just provide the <strong>actual position</strong> of the carrier, but also a way to <strong>call the dispensary</strong>. Needless to say, the "call us" button was tapped everytime the carrier slightly modified its main route. To avoid that, a soft-alert was implemented later on.</p><div class="row-content double-column"><article><img src="img/img-cancare-delivering.jpg" alt="Cancare Delivering"></article><article><img src="img/img-cancare-map.jpg" alt="Cancare Map"></article></div></div><div class="row"><h5>Apple Watch tracking</h5><p>Considering the <strong>limited capabilities</strong> of wearable devices, the Apple Watch app focuses solely on the <strong>tracking</strong> feature.
